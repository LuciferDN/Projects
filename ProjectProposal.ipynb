    "  Safety is always one of our biggest concerns. Crimes are what most people don’t like to happen and what police officers are trying to eliminate because we all want to live in a safe place. Therefore, we choose this research question to find the top crime types and potential victims. The result can be helpful and critical for both residents and police officers in LA. From the result, potential victims know that they should be on guard and protect themselves away from crimes, and the government can save human and money resources to strengthen protection and increase case handling efficiency.\n",
    "  According to crime map provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, among 665 recorded crimes between 02-11-2019 to 02-17-2019, the top three crime types were: larceny (174), vehicle break-in/theft (174), and assault (102). Larceny and vehicle break-in/theft together accounted for half of the total crimes recorded in that time period. We hope that we will get a similar result. However, the regions where these crimes happened are different. For instance, in Hollywood, the major crime type is vehicle break-in/theft. As in “Mapping and Analysis for Public Safety”, geography is a major influence on crime. Major crime types vary in regions. When we analysis crime data, we will take the region into consideration.\n",

If we can not find what to measure in our data, this means we will have to redefine our question until we find a question that we can measurable data. Third steps, once we have our question ready, knows what to measure, and how to measure, we will collect data and organize it. We will use a pivot table to sort and filter data by different variables. This allows us to get the mean, maximum, minimum and standard deviation of our data. Since our research question is finding the top three crime types and give warnings to the main victim types of each crime for each city police department in the LA county. We will use pandas.pivot_table() to find our top three crime types from the 2010 to 2018 data. It will allow us to find the most active crime to least active crime from our data.

We found an official and high credible source because we do not want to face any privacy issue. However, in any research on datasets privacy concerns would eventually happen especially when you deal with the true data collected from real people and real incidents. therefore, if we face an issue like that we can use safe harbor method to fix this problem.\n"

On the other hand, we may need to check if our dataset can be used to predict future crime happening accurately. Also, we may do more in-depth research on the background information to see if there are some details we missed that could cause us to have a wrong prediction. \n",
    " We are predicting future crime by looking at the data from the past. Therefore, if we are not anticipating the future crime right, then it could be a significant event that could cause the people to change people's behavior. For example, the government can provide enough food so that people no longer need to assault someone and ask for money. On the other hand, if the government improves the security on the street, it could also affect our prediction on future crime trending. \n"
